# marteverse
An ode to the C++ framework for developing real-time deterministic advanced applications, MARTe.

MARTe is a toolkit for developing applications that interact with physical systems, or in general
any systems which require a high reliability, high availability, low latency, low jitter response.
It originates from research in the Fusion Energy field.  It is open source.  It is currently used
by engineers and scientists in the Fusion field, including members of the Infinnovation team.

This project has been created to provide a collection of high level documentation, guides, tutorials,
how-to's and the like to support an initiative to bring MARTe from the lab to the world at large.

## MARTe (1.0)
In the late 90's, a highly creative team of engineers at the Culham Center for Fusion Energy were engaged in 
creating a series of innovative, real-time control systems for the JET tokamak.  Led by Filippo Sartori, an 
inspired Italian Electrical Engineer, they used successive projects to carve a reusable framework optimised
for these projects.  The resulting project was the Multi-threaded Application for Real-Time execution (MARTe).

The key principles of MARTe are 
1. Deterministic embedded execution
2. Lightweight and self contained code base
3. Highly portable and extensible
4. Focus on mission, no bloat, delegate wider services via interfaces
5. High quality components, tested, stable.
6. Application reuse through a runtime configuration language.
7. An application is a tree of cooperating objects.
8. Strong support for live introspection without compromising application integrity.
9. Application agnostic (modules are maximally reusable)
